# Project details:
## Level 1: Beginner 
  ### Task 1: HTML Structure and Basic Server Interaction

    Objective: Introduce the concept of server-side rendering and basic form submissions.
    Steps:
    1. Create an HTML structure with forms for user input.
    2. Set up a simple Node.js server using Express.
    3. Create server-side endpoints to handle form submissions.
    4. Use server-side rendering (e.g., EJS) to dynamically generate HTML.

  ### Task 2: Inline Styles, Basic Interaction, and Server-Side Validation

    Objective: Expand inline styles and introduce server-side validation for form submissions.
    Steps:
    1. Extend HTML with more complex forms and user interactions.
    2. Utilize inline JavaScript for client-side form validation.
    3. Implement server-side validation for submitted form data.
    4. Store validated data in temporary server-side storage.

## Level 2: Intermediate
  ### Task 3: Advanced CSS Styling and Responsive Design

    Objective: Enhance CSS styling and make the webpage fully responsive.
    Steps:
    1. Create a more complex layout with multiple sections.
    2. Experiment with CSS properties for advanced styling (e.g., transitions, animations).
    3. Utilize a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap) for a consistent and responsive UI.

### Task 4: Complex Form Validation and Dynamic DOM Manipulation

    Objective: Extend form validation and implement dynamic updates to the DOM.
  
    Steps:
    1.Enhance form validation to include more complex rules (e.g., password strength).
    2.Dynamically update the DOM based on user interactions using JavaScript.
    3.Implement client-side routing for a smoother user experience.
 
 
## Level 3: Advanced 
  ### Task 5: API Integration and Front-End Interaction

    Objective: Introduce server-client communication through a RESTful API.

    Steps:

    1.Create RESTful API endpoints on the server for handling CRUD operations.

    2.Develop a front-end interface that interacts with your own server API.

    3.Fetch and display data from your API on the front end.
